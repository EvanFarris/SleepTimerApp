# Sleep Timer App
## Google Play Store Link
This app can be found on the Google Play Store, at: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gmail.efarrisdevelopment.usa.sleeptimer

## Usage
  After the app is installed, grant the app the admin permission to lock the device. After the permission is granted, a user can create a timer that will automatically
  lock their device, once the timer goes off. The user can also cancel any existing sleep timer, which hasn't gone off.

## Reasoning behind creating this app (concise, personal)
I wanted to watch streams on the twitch.tv app while falling asleep, but if I did, once my content creator ended their stream, the app auto-hosts another streamer. 
Thus, my phone would just continuously be on, throughout the night, while I was sleeping.
This resulted in my phone either being dead (not plugged in) when I woke up, or extremely hot (plugged in), to the point where I couldn't handle my phone without burning myself.

## Reasoning behind creating this app (long, formal)
  The native lock screen timeout function locks the phone after a set number of seconds/minutes have occured, where the user has not touched their device's screen. This is a 
  good method to save battery life, but it is not perfect. In the case of watching media, such as a movie or a stream, the timeout starts it's countdown after the content is either
  paused, or if the content ends. In today's day and age, companies have implemented features into their product, which will automatically play another video/stream once the original
  content has finished. Not all products with the autoplay feature have a way to turn off autoplay. This presents the problem where if there is seemingly endless content, the user's device
  will never turn off, even if the user is not watching their device. This results in two extremes: The first extreme occurs when the device is not plugged in to it's charger, then the phone will run out of battery.
  The other extreme occurs when the device is charging: The constant charging can overheat the phone's battery, which  reduces the battery's lifespan, and it can be extremely hot to the touch.
  So, the result of the initial problem can range from the inconvenience of having to charge the phone, to possible burns. Thus requiring a solution, which is a sleep timer. 
  When used in an appropriate manner, this app will lock the phone before it runs out of battery, or it will promote safe charging.
